## This are cache functions in order to minimize calculation times
## makeCacheMatrix and cacheSolve

## makeCacheMatrix creates a matrix and save its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## cacheSolve retrieves the value of the inverse if it was calculated before with makeCacheMatrix

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
